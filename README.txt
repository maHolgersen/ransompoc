i will not be held responsible for any damage that may be inflicted by running this script.
for as right now it does not return a file to its 100% origin, i strongly advice to not encrypting any files not backed up.

Run the script inside the 'TestMeHere folder, and follow the instructions in the terminal,
do not try to decrypt a file with a wrong password, use the same password as used for encrypting
i recomend using 'test' for a testing purpose.

I have out commented the line that deletes the file after encryption, so it should be fairly safe to run even outside
the 'TestMeHere', folder this only goes for the source code in the project folder NOT the script in the 'TestMeHere' folder
